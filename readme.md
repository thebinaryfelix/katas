What is a kata?

> katas are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique

If you wish to know more, take a look on [Codewar's wiki on Github](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata)

This is a repository for storing my own solutions of some katas. Most challenges are from [CodeWars](http://codewars.com) basically only using *Javascript* until now.
